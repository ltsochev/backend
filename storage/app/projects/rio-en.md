## Rio.bg
### The best deals and things to do near you

Rio.bg is a project that harnesses the power of group shopping to offer the best 
local and national deals in the city where the client resides. The site supports multiple location detection
methods to ease up the whole geolocation detection mechanism. It is a mobile first website so in this regard it is 
fully responsive and supports well over 9 resolution types because of the unique custom elements that it has. I made sure rio.bg 
has one of the best SEO optimizations among its competition and I even hired multiple 3rd party corporations to make an SEO audit and have
followed the advices of all of them. 

The website has deep filtration system to ease it's users in finding what they need. It also provides recommendations based on past
searches and offer visits. We've baked in an online reservation system that allows clients to request dates for hotels. 

Rio.bg uses heavily modified version of Laravel 5.x and in itself it's a spectacular and massive online shopping platform 
with a heavy administration backend with ACL permission system that generates invoices, contracts, annexes and 
gives tools to its partners to preview and control the offers that concern their businesses. 

The backend system aggregates and analyzes all user interaction and provides user tagging on ad platforms like Facebook and Google.

The custom deployment system that Rio.bg has allows for deploy rollback to the latest stable version in case some bug inadvertently lands into production.
