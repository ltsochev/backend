## Kristin Kostova - Illustrator artist
### Personal webpage and portfolio gallery

The personal page of Kristina Kostova was ordered to be dark, simple and with focus toward paintings, drawings and contacts form.
The page is hosted fully on the cloud with the goal of minimizing montly bills for the client all the while improving speed, reliability and uptime.
Due to the site using Amazon S3 we have included automatic backup system of all uploaded paintings. The website is adjusted to be used with mobile devices.

The gallery is an in-house development with very specific requirements. While uploading a painting it's compiled into multiple resolutions so that later on mobile devices wouldn't have to generate excessive traffic by downloading larger images. The gallery also preserves the original image with maximum quality which allows highest resolution downloads for her fans.

The website supports multiple social features like live chat, through facebook and email contacts.

SEO optimizations on all important pages is also included for the search engines (Google, Bing etc.)
