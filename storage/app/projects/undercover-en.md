## Undercover The Game
### Massive Multiplayer Browser Game

Undercover is a game developed alongside the popular bulgarian TV series "Undercover" that was broadcasted in
multiple countries. The game was licensed and was using **real time** technology to allow combat between 1v1 or 5v5 battle royales.
The game had faction wars and territory wars with daily, weekly and monthly rewards and achievements for the best players.
The backend was written in Java and was made to be cloud scalable. The fight client was written in Flash before it was retired by
browser vendors. The game had thousands of users online taking the role of a cop or a bandit, fighting for control over the city from multiple countries.

Undercover had a strong social aspect with clans, friends, factions, real-time messaging system over web using HTML 5 and a strong
localization module to ensure the translation was on par for every player.
