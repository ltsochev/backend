## Streetmobster
### Online gangster game

Streetmobster is a free online mafia game that gives you the opportunity to claim your piece of the streets.
This is one of my first projects that I've worked on professionally 

At its peak the game supported tens of thousands of players online, whom generated millions of impressions per day because back in the day when the game was popular, web technologies were lacking and didn't support real-time communication unless the users installed browser plugins.

The game is developed with in-house built framework which prioritizes speed over all else. In its peak hours it could serve web pages well below 150ms. The game supported high concurrency through its near real-time auctions between the players, chat rooms without plugins and massive battles.

Streetmobster is a product that supports multiple locales and it has its own system for dynamic translations. The game is publishe worldwide by worldwide publishers of online games, with each market having its own localized version of the game, including countries from the middle-east. Yes, that's right, the game supported right-to-left text orientation.

In 2014 the project has been sold to Big Mage Studios and it is actively developed solely by them to this day.
